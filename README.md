# Acupuncture

This repository provides some resources about 3 main techniques of acupuncture: chinese acupuncture, ear acupuncture and YNSA.
Some documents are english others are french. The most detailed one, describes the so called YNSA (Yamamoto New Scalp Acupuncture) to its finest technique.

The idea of these books is to share valuable information to other therapeuts or any one interested in the technique of acupuncture. 

I created or translated several other books which are not free of use. Under the proof that the corresponding books were bought in their original language I will be happy to share them as well. For more information, please contact me.
